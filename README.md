In a separate bowl, whisk 1 egg, then add 1 1/4 cups of milk, 3 tablespoons of melted butter, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract if desired. Combine the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined (the batter should be slightly lumpy). Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly grease it. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form and edges are set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 1-2 minutes. Serve warm with your favorite toppings."/>
